# reason-engines
a modular reasoning framework that mimics XAI's approach to problem-solving, focused on evaluating information critically and generating reliable conclusions.

## How to Use
Prepare the JSON File: Create a file named input.json with the structure shown above, containing data for all components.
Run the Code: Save the Python code as, e.g., framework.py. Ensure the JSON file is in the same directory (or provide the correct path). 
Run the script: python framework.py
Output: The script will read the JSON file and print results for each component:
Confidence score (e.g., 0.88 for a primary academic source).
Analysis mode (e.g., 'deep' for a complex query).
Consensus status (e.g., 'no_consensus' for mixed sources).
Reasoning conclusion (e.g., “Supply and demand govern prices. Data suggests do tariffs increase prices? likely increases.”).
